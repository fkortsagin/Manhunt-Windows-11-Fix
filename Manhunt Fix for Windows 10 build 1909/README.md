# How to get Manhunt working on Windows 10(builds 1903,1909):

1.Install through Steam

2.Go to Control Panel>Programs>Programs and Features>Turn Windows Features on or off>Legacy Components>Enable Direct Play

3.Run the Manhunt Fix.bat file

4.Disabling audio sound loops completely by removing audio:
- Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Manhunt\audio\PC\SCRIPTED\PORN folder and find the file named PORN.RIB and change it to something like p0rn.RIB
- Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Manhunt\audio\PC\SCRIPTED\CRAPPER folder and find the file named CRAPPER.RIB and change it to something like cr@pper.RIB
- Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Manhunt\audio\PC\SCRIPTED\CRAPPER folder and find the file named CRAPPER.RIB and change it to something like cr@pper.RIB

That's it,you are good to go,enjoy the game.

All the credit goes to the creators of the original Manhunt fix patch and the d3d8.dll wrapper find them somewhere here in Steam threads,also additional credit goes to the creator of WideScreen Patch ThirteenAG and crosire for creating the FPS limit wrapper.I just combined everything that worked for me,hopefully will work for you as well and you will avoid the headache with workarounds.
